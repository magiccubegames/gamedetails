Merge and Blade is a fantasy puzzle game.<br>
You will engage in large-scale battles with monsters<br>with your own squad which is made using merge mechanics.<br><br>
After a battle, you can recruit new units using merge mechanics.<br>
By proceeding with these puzzles and battles, you will retake the castles occupied by monsters.<br><br>

As you retake the castle one by one, your base and squad get stronger.<br>
Your journey will continue until retaking the last castle.<br><br>
But, even if you retake the last castle, your journey won't completely end.<br><br>
There are endless invading monsters that you have to hold off.<br>
You can battle with your friends or can save the world again with another strategy.<br><br>
Are you ready to save this world?<br><br><br>

This game is a puzzle that builds blocks that come down like Tetris, Hexa, and Puyo Puyo.<br>
But it's not about holding out for a long time or removing blocks.<br>
it's about merging the same three or more units to create a higher class.<br><br>
The goal of the puzzle is to create a squad as strong as possible within a limited turn.<br>
You can make a much stronger squad or can get additional turns with multi-merge, combo, etc.<br><br><br>

Battles are performed in real-time up to 25 v 25.<br><br>

In battles, formation is important, as well as each unit's stats.<br>
This is because each unit has its own attack types and attack or heal ranges<br>
So it's good to care about the position of the unit when you place units in the puzzle part.<br>
In addition, you can use swaps to change their position in battle.<br><br>

You can use gold from puzzles and battles to upgrade your base and units in your squad.<br>
Base upgrades provide unlocking the merging list and adding the number of turns, previews, and swap.<br>
Units upgrades increase the unit's HP and ATK, giving you an advantage in battles.<br><br>
